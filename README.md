# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions to Advent of Code over the years.

Not everything is complete; I use this as practice for algorithmic thinking and knowledge of new algoriths to accomplish hard computing problems.

Each year is in its own branch.

| Year | Progress | Stars |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 2020 |   15/25  | 26/50 |
| 2019 |    6/25  | 12/50 |
| 2018 |   10/25  | 19/50 |

They are written in **Python**.
